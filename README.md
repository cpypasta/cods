This is an R Shiny application that was created as part of a Masters in Business Analytics. The purpose of this analyis was to examine the relationship between COVID-19 causes of death. 

The `app.R` and `utils.R` files have all the logic to run the Shiny app. The `data_prep.R` has all the logic to go from the original dataset sources to the RDS files that get used by the Shiny app.

You can find the app hosted on [Shinyapps](https://broller.shinyapps.io/cods/).
